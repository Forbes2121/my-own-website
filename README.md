This is my first ever attempt at creating a website from scratch.

It mainly focuses on me, and some things about my life.

Certainly more work to be done, but an exciting first step on my road to becoming a coder!

Please let me know if you have any tips, tricks, or suggestions for the website.


Peace and love,

Tyler Forbes
